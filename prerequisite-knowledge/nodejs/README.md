# Node.js

Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, back-end JavaScript runtime environment that is built on the [V8 JavaScript engine of Google Chrome](https://v8.dev/). It allows developers to use JavaScript to write **server-side applications** that can run on different operating systems like Windows, macOS, and Linux.

### Some of the key concepts and modules in Node.js that are important to know before learning NestJS:

1. **Asynchronous programming**: Node.js is known for its non-blocking, asynchronous I/O model. It is important to understand how asynchronous programming works in Node.js, and how to use callbacks, promises, and async/await to handle asynchronous operations.

2. **[HTTP module](https://github.com/shounoop/my-nestjs/tree/main/prerequisite-knowledge/commonjs)**: Node.js has a built-in HTTP module that allows you to create and handle HTTP servers and clients. It is important to understand the basics of HTTP, such as HTTP methods, request and response headers, and status codes.

3. **Express framework**: Express is a popular Node.js web framework that is often used in conjunction with NestJS. It is recommended to have a basic understanding of Express, including routing, middleware, and template engines.

4. **NPM (Node Package Manager)**: NPM is a package manager for Node.js that is used to manage and install packages and dependencies. It is important to understand how to use NPM to install and manage packages, as well as how to create and publish your own packages.

5. **[CommonJS modules](https://github.com/shounoop/my-nestjs/tree/main/prerequisite-knowledge)**: Node.js uses the CommonJS module system, which allows you to break your code into reusable modules. It is important to understand how to use require() and module.exports to import and export modules.

### Some of the core features of Node.js are:

1. Event-driven architecture: Node.js is built on an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that allows it to handle a large number of concurrent requests without blocking the execution thread.

2. NPM (Node Package Manager): NPM is a package manager for Node.js that provides a vast collection of pre-built packages that can be used in Node.js applications.

3. Fast execution: Node.js applications are executed very fast because they are written in JavaScript and run on the V8 engine.

4. Scalability: Node.js is designed to handle a large number of connections and requests simultaneously, making it ideal for building scalable applications.

### Some of the key concepts in Node.js include:

1. Modules: Node.js uses a module system that allows you to organize your code into reusable components.

2. Callbacks: Node.js uses callbacks to handle asynchronous code execution.

3. Streams: Node.js supports streaming data, which allows you to read or write data in chunks instead of loading the entire data into memory.

4. Events: Node.js has a built-in event module that allows you to create and handle custom events.

5. File system: Node.js has a built-in file system module that allows you to read, write, and manipulate files on the file system.
