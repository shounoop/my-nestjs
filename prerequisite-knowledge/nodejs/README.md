# Node.js

Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, back-end JavaScript runtime environment that is built on the [V8 JavaScript engine of Google Chrome](https://v8.dev/). It allows developers to use JavaScript to write **server-side applications** that can run on different operating systems like Windows, macOS, and Linux.
