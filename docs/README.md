# Documentation | NestJS

- NestJS is a popular open-source Node.js framework that is used for building scalable and efficient server-side applications. It is built on top of Express.js, which is a popular web application framework for Node.js, and is heavily inspired by Angular, which is a popular front-end JavaScript framework.

- NestJS provides a modular structure for building applications, which makes it easier to organize and maintain code. It also comes with a built-in dependency injection system, which makes it easier to manage dependencies and promote reusability.

- NestJS also provides a range of features such as middleware, routing, and error handling, which makes it easier to build robust and reliable applications. It also provides support for a range of databases such as MySQL, MongoDB, and PostgreSQL, which makes it easier to build data-driven applications.

- NestJS is a popular choice for building enterprise-level applications, and it has a large and active community of developers who contribute to its development and provide support.

### Here are some important concepts and features of NestJS that you'll need to understand in order to build a simple project:

| Feature                                                                           | Concept                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

| [Controllers](https://github.com/shounoop/my-nestjs/tree/main/docs/controllers)   | Controllers are responsible for handling incoming HTTP requests and returning an HTTP response. In NestJS, controllers are classes decorated with the @Controller decorator, and they contain methods that handle specific HTTP requests. For example, a UserController class might contain methods like getUser and createUser to handle GET and POST requests for user data. |
| [Providers](https://github.com/shounoop/my-nestjs/tree/main/docs/providers)       | Providers are a way to organize and share code across your application. Providers can be used for things like database connections, services, or other business logic. In NestJS, providers are decorated with the @Injectable decorator, and can be injected into other classes using dependency injection.                                                                   |
| [Modules](https://github.com/shounoop/my-nestjs/tree/main/docs/modules)           | Modules are a way to organize your code and dependencies into logical groups. In NestJS, modules are decorated with the @Module decorator, and can define controllers, providers, and other modules that your application depends on.                                                                                                                                          |
| [Decorators](https://github.com/shounoop/my-nestjs/tree/main/docs/decorators)     | Decorators are a way to attach metadata to classes, methods, and properties in your code. In NestJS, decorators are used extensively to define routes, middleware, and other application features. Some commonly used NestJS decorators include @Get, @Post, @Param, @Body, and @Middleware.                                                                                   |
| [Pipes](https://github.com/shounoop/my-nestjs/tree/main/docs/pipes)               | Pipes are used for data validation and transformation in NestJS. Pipes can be used to ensure that incoming data meets certain criteria, or to transform incoming data into a different format. For example, a ParseIntPipe could be used to ensure that an incoming string is converted to an integer before it is processed by your application.                              |
| [Interceptors](https://github.com/shounoop/my-nestjs/tree/main/docs/interceptors) | Interceptors are a way to modify incoming or outgoing HTTP requests and responses. Interceptors can be used for things like logging, error handling, or modifying the response data. In NestJS, interceptors are classes decorated with the @Injectable decorator, and can be attached to controllers or specific routes using the @UseInterceptors decorator.                 |
| [Guards](https://github.com/shounoop/my-nestjs/tree/main/docs/guards)             | Guards are a way to restrict access to certain routes or actions based on certain criteria. Guards can be used for things like authentication, authorization, or other types of access control. In NestJS, guards are classes decorated with the @Injectable decorator, and can be attached to controllers or specific routes using the @UseGuards decorator.                  |

&rarr; Using these concepts and features, you can build a simple CRUD application in NestJS by defining a controller with methods for creating, reading, updating, and deleting data, and using providers for database connections and other business logic.\
&rarr; You can then use modules to organize your code, and use decorators, pipes, interceptors, and guards to add additional functionality and security to your application.
