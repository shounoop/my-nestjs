# Controllers

Controllers are responsible for handling incoming HTTP requests and returning an HTTP response. In NestJS, controllers are classes decorated with the @Controller decorator, and they contain methods that handle specific HTTP requests. For example, a UserController class might contain methods like getUser and createUser to handle GET and POST requests for user data.
